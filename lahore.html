    <h2>Lahore Best Place For Culture</h2>
    <p>
      If you only have time to visit one place in Pakistan, make sure it’s
      Lahore. A Unesco City of Literature, and home to multiple Unesco World
      Heritage Sites, this ancient Mughal city is not only one of the most
      historic places in the country, it also hosts a thriving modern cultural
      scene.

      Lahore Fort has recently been restored with support from the Aga Khan
      Trust for Culture, the Shalimar Gardens are one of the world’s finest
      Persian-style gardens, and the magnificent Badshahi Mosque is one of
      Pakistan’s most famous landmarks; in fact, it's one of the most striking
      religious buildings on the planet. The city’s food scene is fabulous, too.

      There’s an old Punjabi saying that goes:
      <strong><q>Anyone who hasn’t seen Lahore simply hasn’t lived.</q></strong>
      Staring out my rickshaw while riding through the vibrant and bustling
      streets of this city, that phrase made more and more sense to me.

      Lahore, the cultural heart and food capital of Pakistan, is filled with
      life, action, and colors. With a population of <b>11.1 million</b> this
      city is also dubbed as the <b><q>City of Gardens</q></b> thanks to its
      abundance of parks and green spaces.
