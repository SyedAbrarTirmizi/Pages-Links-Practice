      Imagine if you could click your fingers and forget everything you’ve heard
      about Pakistan. Well, this is your chance – just click your mouse and
      you’ll be on your way to discovering a country that’s not defined by the
      media. This is a land of incredible treks through soaring mountains, one
      whose terrain is as enrapturing as its history. From the capital of
      Islamabad to the mystical Hunza Valley, Pakistan has felt the subtle touch
      of the world’s greatest empires and the brute force of the world’s most
      complex conflicts. And through it all, the Pakistani people remain humble,
      hopeful and unconditionally hospitable – come and see it for yourself.
