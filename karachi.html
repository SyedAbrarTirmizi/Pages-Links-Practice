      You won’t find many Western-style nightclubs in Pakistan, as the country
      is officially alcohol-free (unless you have a government permit), but
      there’s still plenty to do in Karachi once the sun goes down. Venues like
      Base Rock Cafe and The Second Floor (T2F) attract an enthusiastic audience
      of live music lovers, and Burns Road and Rashid Minhas Road are packed
      every evening as foodies flock to their buzzing restaurants and street
      food stalls. Combined with the city’s expansive beaches, it’s an
      experience many travelers are surprised to find in Pakistan.
